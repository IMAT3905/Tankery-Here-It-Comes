/*! \mainpage IMAT3904 - Game Engine
*
* This program demonstrates the use of rendering techniques using OpenGL and GLFW.
* The program currently has a 2D batch renderer and a normal 3D renderer
* Along with the renderer, the project has multiple perspective cameras with different controls
*
* Control for the camera:
*	- Press '1' Key - Rotation Camera
	- Press '2' Key- First Person Camera
	- W,A,S,D - directional Movement and Mouse controls
	- Space - Toggle between First Person Camera and Follow Camera
	- Follow Camera - W,A,S,D direction movement | Z,X - Up/Down Movement | Q,E - Rotate follow camera
*
* Text at the bottom tells the active camera type
* 
* FPS Counter at the top left - FPS Capped at 60
